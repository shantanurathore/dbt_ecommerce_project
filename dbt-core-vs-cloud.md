# dbt Core vs. dbt Cloud

## dbt Core (Local Installation)
- Open-source command-line tool
- Runs on your local machine
- You manage your own development environment
- Version control is done manually (e.g., using Git)
- Typically used for development and testing

## dbt Cloud
- Web-based SaaS platform
- Runs in the cloud
- Managed environment with built-in IDE
- Integrated version control
- Offers scheduling, logging, and collaboration features
- Provides a development environment and handles production runs

## Key Differences
- **Setup**: Core requires local installation, Cloud is accessed via web browser
- **Workflow**: Core uses local files and command line, Cloud uses web IDE
- **Scheduling**: Core needs external tools, Cloud has built-in scheduler
- **Collaboration**: Core relies on external tools, Cloud has native features
- **Cost**: Core is free, Cloud has free and paid tiers

## When to Use Each
- Use Core for local development, learning dbt, or in environments where cloud solutions aren't feasible
- Use Cloud for team collaboration, production deployments, or when you need a managed environment
